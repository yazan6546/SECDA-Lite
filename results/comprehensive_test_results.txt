1. FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION STATUS:
✓ SystemC 2.3.3 successfully integrated and compiled
✓ SECDA-Lite delegate compiled with -DSYSC flag
✓ Binary execution without hanging (SystemC sc_main properly handled)
✓ TensorFlow Lite framework working with delegate provider

2. PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS:

BASELINE CPU PERFORMANCE (without delegate):
MobileNetV1 (224x224 input): 691.154 ms average inference time
